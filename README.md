## homework1

First project assignment report, using latex.

If you want to use my paper structure, you have to install a considerable number of packages for tex. So forget it.

## homework2

Second project assignment report. We have updated the toolbox for some new functions.

## homework3

Third project assignment supporting materials.

The toolbox has updated to the latest version which contains all the tools for image histogram equalization, histogram specialization, local histogram transformation and image segmentation using histogram thresholding.

## homework4

Forth project assignment supporting materials.

The toolbox has updated to the latest version which contains all the basic tools for spacial filtering including gaussian filter and high-pass filter module. You can use it directly or see my scripts to learn how to use them.
