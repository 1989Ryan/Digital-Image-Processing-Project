## basic cv toolbox for python

The basic computer vision toolbox for python, which consists of some basic tools for computer vision. Some tools are not covered by opencv. 

This toolbox is only used for DIP course.

### prerequisite

Although no one cares a shit about that project, this toolbox needs python-opencv.

## homework1

First project assignment report, using latex.

If you want to use my paper structure, you have to install a considerable number of packages for tex. So forget it.

## homework2

Second project assignment report. We have updated the toolbox for some new functions.

## homework3

Third project assignment supporting materials.

The toolbox has been updated to the latest version which contains all the tools for image histogram equalization, histogram specialization, local histogram transformation and image segmentation using histogram thresholding.

## homework4

Forth project assignment supporting materials.

The toolbox has been updated to the latest version which contains all the basic tools for spacial filtering including gaussian filter and high-pass filter module. You can use it directly or see my scripts to learn how to use it.

## homework5

Fifth project assignment supporting materials.

The toolbox has been updated to the latest version which contains all the basic tools for frequency domain filtering including BLPF, GLPF, BHPF, GHPF, Laplacian and Unsharp Masking. You can see my script to learn how to use it.
